The byte offset field in the <br>DQM message will thereby indicate the size of the data value. <br><br>Registers 15 and 31 may be set to generate Ownership trace message or DQM using <br>teInstrumentation. A write to itcStimulus may also cause an External Trigger Out if <br>enabled by xtoEvent and itcTrigEnable. <br>Note that this field is volatile and may be masked in IP-XACT. |
